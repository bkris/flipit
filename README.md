# 1. Project setup

To install all the dependencies, run `npm install` in the project root.
You might also need to install npx globally to be able to run the scripts,
you can do it by running `npm install -g npx`. 

Afterwards you can start the application by running `npm start`.
This will start the application server and will also output the URL where you can reach it.
By default, this is `http://localhost:3000`. The `start` NPM script runs `nodemon` behind the scenes, so your 
changes to the application will be picked up and the server application will be restarted automatically to contain your latest modifications.
